[b][u][h2]About this mod:[/h2][/u][/b]
This mod adds a new type of furniture called "Biome Extractor" to the game. When placed, this machine will extract items from the biome it's in and then store them in an adjacent chest.

There are seven types of Biome Extractors, each one more powerful and able to access more loot than the last, and it all starts from a simple Extractinator.
Speaking of, this mod also makes it possible to purchase Extractinators from the Mechanic.

[u]Disclaimer:[/u] by "extracting from the biome" we mean "generating items related to the biome from nothing".

[b][u][h2]Compatibility notes:[/h2][/u][/b]

[*] This mod can deposit items inside Magic Storage systems: all you need to do is place them beside a connected Storage Configuration Interface.
